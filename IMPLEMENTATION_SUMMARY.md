## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks are still pending:

1. **Complete context provider tests**:
   - AuthContext tests
   - CartContext tests
   - CurrencyContext tests

2. **Finalize integration testing**:
   - Blog API endpoint tests
   - Order API endpoint tests
   - Authentication flow tests

3. **Complete E2E testing**:
   - Admin workflow tests
   - Checkout flow tests
   - User account management tests

4. **Additional performance optimizations**:
